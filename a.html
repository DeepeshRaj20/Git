    <h2>My World</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The world is a beautiful place for about 7 billion people. All the
        people are fortunate to have access to resources and a place where they
        can live peacefully. Our world is filled with amazing people who can
        speak different languages, live in different places, and follow
        different traditions. But the morals, values, and compassion towards
        each other remain the same. The world consists of amazing people along
        with natural resources, flora, and fauna. These natural resources
        include mountains, rivers, oceans, forests, hills, etc.
